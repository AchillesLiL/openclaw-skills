- Existing suck: 13/15 -- people complain existing tools are expensive
- Complaints: 12/15 -- multiple threads with 20+ upvotes
- Monetizable: 13/15 -- accountants/bookkeepers use daily
- No moat: 10/15 -- no dominant simple tool

### Example 2: "Simple status page for small SaaS" (Score: 82)
- Buildable: 18/20 -- basic uptime check + public page
- Clear use case: 18/20 -- "show if service is up or down"
- Existing suck: 12/15 -- StatusPage.io is expensive, overkill
- Complaints: 10/15 -- regular complaints about pricing
- Monetizable: 12/15 -- every SaaS needs one
- No moat: 12/15 -- lots of room for simpler alternatives

## Low-Scoring Idea Examples (<50)

### Example: "AI-powered project management tool" (Score: 35)
- Buildable: 5/20 -- complex, multi-feature, needs AI
- Clear use case: 5/20 -- too broad, "project management" is vague

- Complaints: 8/15 -- people complain but about specific features
- Monetizable: 10/15 -- B2B, would pay
- No moat: 2/15 -- dominated by well-funded companies
