# Making New Friends

## The Hard Truth

After school/college, making friends requires deliberate effort. There's no built-in social infrastructure. You have to create it.

## Where to Find Friends

**High-frequency environments (best):**
- Classes (language, art, fitness)
- Regular meetups (book clubs, running groups, hobby clubs)
- Coworking spaces, shared offices
- Volunteering with consistent schedules
- Religious/spiritual communities

**Lower frequency but possible:**
- One-off events, conferences
- Apps (Bumble BFF, Meetup)
- Neighbors, local coffee shops

**The key:** Repeated exposure. One encounter rarely creates friendship.

## The Approach Playbook

### Step 1: Show Up Consistently
Same time, same place, same activity. Let people recognize you.

### Step 2: Be Approachable
- Arrive early, stay late (natural conversation windows)
- Put phone away
- Make eye contact, smile
- Comment on shared experience

### Step 3: Move Beyond the Context
"We should grab coffee sometime" is weak.
"I'm going to [specific thing] on [specific day], want to come?" is strong.

### Step 4: Follow Through
- Text within 24 hours of meeting
- Suggest concrete next step
- Don't wait for them to initiate

## Conversation Escalation

**Level 1: Safe Topics**
Weather, the event, logistics

**Level 2: Opinions**
"What do you think about...?"
"Have you tried...?"

**Level 3: Personal**
"What got you into this?"
"What's your story?"

**Level 4: Vulnerable**
"I've been struggling with..."
"Something I've been thinking about..."

Move through levels as reciprocated. Don't skip levels.

## Common Blocks

**"I'm bad at small talk"**
Small talk is a bridge, not the destination. Get through it to reach real conversation.

**"People are too busy"**
Everyone's busy. The ones who make time are your people. Stop chasing those who don't.

**"I don't have hobbies"**
Start one. Friendships form around shared activities. No activity = no natural meeting ground.

**"I'm an introvert"**
Introversion affects energy, not ability. Schedule social time, then recovery time.

## Realistic Timeline

- **Acquaintance:** 1-3 interactions
- **Casual friend:** 40-60 hours together
- **Close friend:** 200+ hours together

This takes months to years. There are no shortcuts.
