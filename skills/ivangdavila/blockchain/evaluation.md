# Blockchain Evaluation Framework

## When to Use Blockchain

### ✅ USE When:
- **Multiple parties** need shared truth (≥3 organizations)
- **No single trusted authority** exists or is acceptable
- **Immutability** is critical (audit, compliance, legal)
- **Transparency between competitors** creates value
- **Settlement/reconciliation** currently costs millions

### ❌ DON'T USE When:
- Single organization controls all data → **Use a database**
- You trust a central authority → **Traditional SaaS**
- High-frequency, low-value transactions → **Standard infra**
- Data needs deletion (GDPR) → **Conflicts with immutability**
- Internal process problem → **ERP/workflow tools**
- "Because competitors are doing it" → **Wrong reason**

## The Database Test

> *"Would a well-designed PostgreSQL database with proper access controls solve this?"*
> If yes → Don't use blockchain.

## Enterprise Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Key Feature |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Hyperledger Fabric | General enterprise | Private channels, modular |
| R3 Corda | Financial services | Transaction privacy |
| Enterprise Ethereum | Tokenization | Smart contracts |
| Hedera Hashgraph | High throughput | Fast finality |

## Proven Use Cases (Real ROI)

1. **Supply chain traceability** — Provenance, fraud reduction
2. **Cross-border payments** — Settlement time: days → minutes
3. **Asset tokenization** — Real estate, securities access
4. **Digital identity/KYC** — W3C DIDs, verifiable credentials
5. **Audit-ready data sharing** — Healthcare, insurance, multi-party

## Common Pitfalls

1. **No clear business case** — "Blockchain for blockchain's sake"
2. **Technology before problem** — Platform chosen before workflow defined
3. **Insufficient consortium buy-in** — One company ≠ network effects
4. **Ignoring governance** — Who updates rules? Who resolves disputes?
5. **Underestimating integration** — Legacy systems don't magically connect
6. **Regulatory blind spots** — Compliance isn't optional
7. **Expecting immediate ROI** — 18-36 months typical timeline

## Evaluation Questions

Ask vendors:
- "What problem does this solve that a shared database with audit logs cannot?"
- "How many partners are committed to the consortium?"
- "What's the governance model for rule changes?"
- "What's the realistic timeline to production value?"

If unclear answers → Walk away.
